Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) is critical in project-based industries such as construction, energy, and telecommunications. Current CLM tools rely on rule-based automation or single-agent Large Language Models (LLMs), resulting in limited scalability, poor explainability, and lack of domain-specific optimization. This thesis proposes the design and evaluation of multi-agentic AI systems for contract lifecycle management in B2B SaaS platforms.

The research addresses key challenges in current CLM systems: lack of scalable orchestration for complex workflows, explainability gaps in AI-driven decisions, and insufficient compliance and regulatory constraint handling. The proposed approach leverages multi-agent systems (MAS) to enable specialized task decomposition, collaboration, and enhanced explainability in enterprise workflows.

This work contributes to both academic research and practical applications by developing a framework for MAS design in regulated enterprise workflows, providing comparative empirical results between single-agent and multi-agent approaches, and establishing evaluation methodologies for compliance-aware AI systems. The research directly informs the development of next-generation CLM platforms while maintaining discretion regarding proprietary implementation details.
