\section{Schedule}\label{section:schedule}

\textbf{Phase 1: Foundation Framework Design (October - November 2025)}
Study industry foundation papers on multi-agent systems and enterprise AI frameworks. Design focused multi-agent architecture for contract analysis with 2-3 specialized agents. Define agent roles, communication protocols, and system requirements.
\newline
\break
\textbf{Phase 2: Prototype Implementation (December 2025 - January 2026)}
Develop working prototype using Python with NLP libraries (spaCy, transformers). Implement agent communication protocols, contract processing pipeline, basic explainability features, and simple web interface for testing.
\newline
\break  
\textbf{Phase 3: Evaluation and Validation (February - March 2026)}
Conduct comparative evaluation using real contract datasets. Test multi-agent vs single-agent performance, assess explainability features, and validate system reliability. Complete data analysis and results documentation.
\newline

\textbf{Milestones:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item November 2025: Framework design complete, agent roles defined
    \item January 2026: Working prototype with core functionality
    \item March 2026: Evaluation complete, thesis writing finished
\end{itemize}
