\section{Challenges in Current CLM Systems}

Contract Lifecycle Management systems face several critical challenges that limit their effectiveness in enterprise environments:

\subsection{Scalability and Orchestration Limitations}
Current CLM tools struggle with scalable orchestration for complex workflows involving drafting, negotiation, and compliance monitoring. Traditional rule-based systems require extensive manual configuration and maintenance, while single-agent LLM approaches lack the modularity needed for specialized task handling across different contract types and regulatory domains.

\subsection{Explainability Gap}
AI-driven decisions in contract management often lack sufficient explainability, leading to low enterprise trust and adoption barriers. Users need to understand not only what decisions are made but also the reasoning process behind contract clause recommendations, compliance assessments, and risk evaluations.

\subsection{Compliance and Regulatory Constraints}
Existing AI-based CLM systems inadequately address compliance and regulatory constraints that vary across industries and jurisdictions. The dynamic nature of regulatory requirements and the need for audit trails present significant challenges for current approaches.

\section{Research Gap}

The current state of research reveals several critical gaps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No established frameworks} for multi-agent orchestration specifically designed for enterprise CLM workflows
    \item \textbf{Limited empirical evaluation} comparing single-agent versus multi-agent approaches in contract management contexts
    \item \textbf{Insufficient attention} to compliance-aware AI system design in enterprise environments
    \item \textbf{Lack of standardized evaluation methodologies} for assessing trust and explainability in AI-driven contract management
\end{itemize}

\section{Core Research Problem}

The central problem addressed by this research is: \textbf{How can multi-agent systems be designed and evaluated to improve efficiency, accuracy, and trust in contract lifecycle processes?}

This problem encompasses three key dimensions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Design Challenge:} Developing appropriate MAS architectures for CLM workflows
    \item \textbf{Coordination Challenge:} Establishing effective orchestration and collaboration strategies
    \item \textbf{Evaluation Challenge:} Creating comprehensive assessment frameworks for performance, compliance, and user trust
\end{enumerate}

The solution to this problem requires interdisciplinary research combining multi-agent systems theory, enterprise software architecture, and human-computer interaction principles to create practical, trustworthy, and scalable CLM solutions.
