\section{Problem Statement}\label{section:problem_statement}

Current CLM systems face critical challenges: scalability limitations in complex workflows, insufficient explainability leading to low enterprise trust, and inadequate handling of compliance and regulatory constraints across industries and jurisdictions.
\newline
\break
Research gaps include: no established frameworks for multi-agent orchestration in enterprise CLM workflows, limited empirical evaluation comparing single-agent versus multi-agent approaches, insufficient attention to compliance-aware AI system design, and lack of standardized evaluation methodologies for trust and explainability assessment.
\newline
\break
\textbf{Core Research Problem:} How can multi-agent systems be designed and evaluated to improve efficiency, accuracy, and trust in contract lifecycle processes?
