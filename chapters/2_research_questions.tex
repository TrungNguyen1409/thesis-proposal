\section{Research Questions}\label{section:research_questions}

How can a multi-agent framework be designed and implemented to improve contract analysis efficiency, accuracy, and explainability in enterprise CLM systems, which could be broken down into the following sub-questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What agent specialization patterns are most effective for contract analysis tasks (drafting, review, compliance checking)?
    \item How does a multi-agent approach compare to single-agent systems in contract analysis accuracy and processing time?
    \item What explainability mechanisms are most effective for multi-agent contract analysis systems to ensure transparency and trust in enterprise environments?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Research Objectives:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design a focused multi-agent framework for contract analysis based on industry foundation papers
    \item Develop a working prototype with 2-3 specialized agents
    \item Conduct comparative evaluation using real contract data
    \item Establish practical implementation guidelines for enterprise CLM integration
\end{enumerate}
