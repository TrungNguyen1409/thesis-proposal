\section{Starting Literature}\label{section:starting_literature}

\textbf{Multi-Agent Systems and LLM Applications:} \cite{han2025llmmultiagentsystemschallenges} identify key challenges and open problems in LLM-based multi-agent systems, providing a foundation for understanding scalability and coordination issues. \cite{shu2024effectivegenaimultiagentcollaboration} present design and evaluation frameworks for enterprise GenAI multi-agent collaboration, yet their focus on general enterprise applications lacks specific attention to contract management workflows and compliance requirements. \cite{yehudai2025llmagentevaluationregulated} further highlight the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks for multi-agent systems in regulated enterprise domains.

\textbf{Agent Architecture and Collaboration:} \cite{belcak2025smalllanguagemodelsfuture} explore the potential of small language models for agentic AI, while \cite{wang2024mixtureofagentsenhanceslargelanguage} demonstrate how mixture-of-agents approaches enhance LLM capabilities. \cite{wu2023autogenenablingnextgenllm} introduce AutoGen as a framework for enabling next-generation LLM applications via multi-agent conversation, but these works primarily address general-purpose agent coordination without specialized focus on contract analysis tasks or enterprise compliance constraints.

\textbf{Enterprise Applications and Contract Management:} While recent work focuses on practical implementation of multi-agent systems in enterprise contexts, there is a notable gap in addressing contract-specific challenges such as regulatory compliance, legal terminology processing, and domain-specific explainability requirements. The existing frameworks provide general collaboration patterns but lack specialized architectures for contract lifecycle management workflows.
