\section{Motivation}\label{section:motivation}

Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) \cite{wikipedia2025contractlifecyclemanagement} is critical in enterprise environments, serving as operational and financial anchors for complex projects involving multiple stakeholders and regulatory requirements. Current CLM tools rely on rule-based automation or single-agent LLMs, presenting limitations in scalability, explainability, and domain-specific optimization.
\newline

Multi-agent systems (MAS) offer promising potential for addressing these limitations through specialized task decomposition, inter-agent collaboration, and enhanced explainability mechanisms. However, there is a significant research gap in applying multi-agent systems to enterprise contract management workflows, particularly regarding compliance-aware orchestration and explainability requirements.
\newline
\break
Current CLM systems face critical challenges: scalability limitations in complex workflows, insufficient explainability leading to low enterprise trust, and inadequate handling of compliance and regulatory constraints across industries and jurisdictions.
\newline
\break
Research gaps include: no established frameworks for multi-agent orchestration in enterprise CLM workflows, limited empirical evaluation comparing single-agent versus multi-agent approaches, insufficient attention to compliance-aware AI system design, and lack of standardized evaluation methodologies for trust and explainability assessment.
\newline
\break
\textbf{Core Research Problem:} How can multi-agent systems be designed and evaluated to improve efficiency, accuracy, and trust in contract lifecycle processes?
