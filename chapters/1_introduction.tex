\section{Motivation}\label{section:motivation}

Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) \cite{wikipedia2025contractlifecyclemanagement} is critical in enterprise environments, serving as operational and financial anchors for complex projects involving multiple stakeholders and regulatory requirements, yet current CLM tools rely on rule-based automation or single-agent LLMs, presenting limitations in scalability, explainability, and domain-specific optimization, with critical challenges including scalability limitations in complex workflows, insufficient explainability leading to low enterprise trust, and inadequate handling of compliance and regulatory constraints across industries and jurisdictions.

Multi-agent systems (MAS) offer promising potential for addressing these limitations through specialized task decomposition, inter-agent collaboration, and enhanced explainability mechanisms. However, the application of multi-agent systems to enterprise contract management workflows, particularly regarding compliance-aware orchestration and explainability requirements, remains largely unexplored.

Research gaps include: no established frameworks for multi-agent orchestration in enterprise CLM workflows, limited empirical evaluation comparing single-agent versus multi-agent approaches, insufficient attention to compliance-aware AI system design, and lack of standardized evaluation methodologies for trust and explainability assessment. Recent surveys highlight the absence of standardized frameworks and benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent AI in enterprise workflows, especially regarding compliance and explainability. For instance, \cite{yehudai2025llmagentevaluationregulated} find that 'most LLM agent evaluations focus on single-agent settings, with limited attention to regulated enterprise domains and compliance-aware orchestration'.
