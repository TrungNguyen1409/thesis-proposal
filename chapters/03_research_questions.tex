\chapter{Research Questions}\label{chapter:research_questions}

\textbf{Primary Research Question:} How can multi-agent systems be designed and evaluated to improve efficiency, accuracy, and trust in contract lifecycle management processes?

\textbf{Secondary Research Questions:}

\textbf{RQ1: System Design} - How can multi-agent systems be architected for CLM tasks such as clause extraction, drafting assistance, and compliance monitoring? This explores agent specialization strategies, communication protocols, system scalability, and enterprise integration.

\textbf{RQ2: Coordination and Orchestration} - What orchestration and collaboration strategies enable efficiency and explainability in multi-agent CLM systems? This addresses task decomposition, conflict resolution, explainability frameworks, and performance optimization.

\textbf{RQ3: Comparative Evaluation} - How does a multi-agent approach compare to a single-agent baseline on performance, compliance adherence, and user trust? This establishes empirical evidence through systematic comparison across accuracy, compliance rates, user trust, and system reliability.

\textbf{Research Hypotheses:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item H1: Multi-agent systems will demonstrate superior task specialization and modularity compared to single-agent approaches
    \item H2: MAS-based CLM systems will provide enhanced explainability through distributed reasoning
    \item H3: Multi-agent approaches will achieve higher compliance adherence rates
    \item H4: Users will demonstrate higher trust in MAS-based CLM systems
\end{itemize}
