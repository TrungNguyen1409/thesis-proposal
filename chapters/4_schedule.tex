\section{Timeline \& Risks}\label{section:schedule}

The research project spans from October 2025 to March 2026, structured into three phases with dedicated time for thesis writing.

\subsection{Phase 1: Literature Review + Detailed Planning (October - November 2025)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Study multi-agent systems and enterprise AI frameworks
    \item Design multi-agent architecture for contract analysis (2-3 specialized agents)
    \item Define agent roles, communication protocols, and system requirements
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 2: Prototype Implementation (December 2025 - January 2026)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop working prototype using relevant agentic frameworks and libraries.
    \item Implement modular architecture with JSON/YAML configuration files
    \item Establish agent reasoning pipeline and basic explainability features
    \item \textbf{Key:} Avoid hard-coded features; use configurable parameters for easy experimentation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 3: Evaluation and Validation (February - March 2026)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Conduct comparative evaluation using real contract datasets
    \item Test multi-agent system against single-agent baseline
    \item \textbf{Thesis Writing:} Reserve final 3-4 weeks for writing and quick fixes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Milestones}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{November 2025:} Framework design complete, agent roles defined
    \item \textbf{January 2026:} Working prototype with core functionality achieved
    \item \textbf{March 2026:} Evaluation complete, thesis writing finished
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Risks and Mitigation}

\textbf{Key Technical Risks:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Agent Coordination} – Communication overhead between agents reducing system efficiency
    \item \textbf{Framework Integration} – Challenges integrating LangGraph, LangChain, and Supabase
    \item \textbf{Data Quality} – Limited access to high-quality contract datasets for training and evaluation
    \item \textbf{Evaluation Validity} – Risk of poor evaluation results due to insufficient or low-quality testing data
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mitigation Strategies:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Modular Architecture} – Implement configurable agent communication protocols for easy adjustment
    \item \textbf{Incremental Development} – Build and test components individually before full integration
    \item \textbf{Dataset Preparation} – Use CUAD dataset and synthetic data generation if needed
    \item \textbf{Evaluation Planning} – Design evaluation framework early and validate data quality before testing
\end{itemize}
