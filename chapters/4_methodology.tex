\section{Methodology}\label{section:methodology}

\textbf{Foundation Framework Design}
Based on industry foundation papers (e.g., Wooldridge's MAS principles, enterprise AI frameworks), design a focused multi-agent architecture for contract analysis. Define agent roles: Contract Analyzer Agent (extraction, classification), Compliance Checker Agent (regulatory validation), and Orchestrator Agent (task coordination).

\textbf{Prototype Implementation}
Develop a working prototype implementing the designed framework. Core components: (1) Agent communication protocols using message passing, (2) Contract processing pipeline with NLP integration, (3) Basic explainability features (decision reasoning, confidence scores), (4) Simple web interface for testing.

\textbf{Evaluation and Validation}
Conduct comparative evaluation using real contract datasets. Metrics: (1) Processing accuracy (precision, recall for contract analysis tasks), (2) Performance comparison (multi-agent vs single-agent processing time), (3) User trust assessment through explainability features, (4) System reliability and error handling.

\textbf{Implementation Approach:} Rapid prototyping using Python with existing NLP libraries (spaCy, transformers), agent framework (asyncio for concurrent processing), and evaluation using standard contract analysis benchmarks.
