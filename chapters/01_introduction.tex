\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}

Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) is critical in enterprise environments, serving as operational and financial anchors for complex projects involving multiple stakeholders and regulatory requirements. Current CLM tools rely on rule-based automation or single-agent LLMs, presenting limitations in scalability, explainability, and domain-specific optimization.

Multi-agent systems (MAS) offer promising potential for addressing these limitations through specialized task decomposition, inter-agent collaboration, and enhanced explainability mechanisms. This research addresses the gap in multi-agent system applications for enterprise contract management workflows, particularly regarding compliance-aware orchestration and explainability requirements.

The thesis focuses on designing and evaluating multi-agentic AI systems for CLM tasks, encompassing system architecture design, orchestration strategies, comparative evaluation against single-agent baselines, and user trust assessment.
