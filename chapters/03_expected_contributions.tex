\chapter{Expected Contributions}\label{chapter:expected_contributions}

\textbf{Scientific Contributions:} (1) Framework for MAS design in regulated enterprise workflows, addressing agent specialization strategies, orchestration patterns, and compliance requirements. (2) Comparative empirical results comparing single-agent versus multi-agent approaches in enterprise CLM contexts. (3) Novel evaluation methodology for compliance-aware AI systems, including metrics for regulatory compliance adherence and user trust measurement.

\textbf{Practical Contributions:} (1) Architecture guidance for CLM platform development, including proven coordination strategies and explainability mechanisms. (2) Prototype foundation for MVP development, offering validated multi-agent architecture patterns and tested user interface paradigms. (3) Industry best practices for implementing MAS in enterprise software environments.

The research will contribute to multiple academic domains (Multi-Agent Systems, Enterprise AI, Human-Computer Interaction, Legal Technology) and benefit CLM software vendors, enterprise organizations, and AI system developers. Findings will be disseminated through conference papers, journal articles, and open source contributions.
