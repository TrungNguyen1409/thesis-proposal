\chapter{Methodology}\label{chapter:methodology}

The research will develop a functional MAS-based CLM prototype implementing specialized agents for different CLM tasks (drafting, analysis, compliance), centralized orchestration mechanisms, and integration interfaces for enterprise systems while maintaining discretion regarding proprietary implementation details.

\textbf{Evaluation Framework:} The research will assess MAS effectiveness through quantitative metrics (task completion time, accuracy, compliance adherence, system performance) and qualitative metrics (user comprehension, interface usability, user confidence, adoption willingness).

\textbf{Comparative Analysis:} A systematic comparison will be conducted between single-agent and multi-agent approaches under controlled scenarios, including traditional rule-based CLM systems, single-agent LLM approaches, and hybrid systems.

\textbf{User Study:} Industry professionals (contract managers, legal professionals, IT professionals) will validate practical applicability through task-based evaluation scenarios, think-aloud protocols, and comparative preference studies. Data will be collected from system performance logs, user interactions, expert interviews, and benchmark datasets, with analysis employing statistical methods for quantitative metrics and qualitative content analysis for user feedback.
