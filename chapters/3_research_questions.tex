\section{Research Questions}\label{section:research_questions}

\textbf{Primary Research Question:} How can multi-agent systems be designed and evaluated to improve efficiency, accuracy, and trust in contract lifecycle management processes?

\textbf{Secondary Research Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are the optimal agent specialization strategies and orchestration patterns for CLM workflows?
    \item How do multi-agent approaches compare to single-agent systems in terms of performance, accuracy, and user trust?
    \item What explainability mechanisms are most effective for building user confidence in multi-agent CLM systems?
    \item How can compliance requirements be effectively integrated into multi-agent system design and evaluation?
    \item What are the key factors influencing user acceptance and adoption of multi-agent CLM systems?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Research Objectives:} (1) Design and implement a functional multi-agent CLM prototype, (2) Develop evaluation frameworks for compliance-aware AI systems, (3) Conduct empirical comparison studies, (4) Establish best practices for enterprise MAS deployment.
