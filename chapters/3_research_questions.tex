\section{Research Questions}\label{section:research_questions}

\textbf{Primary Research Question:} How can a multi-agent framework be designed and implemented to improve contract analysis efficiency and accuracy in enterprise CLM systems?

\textbf{Secondary Research Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What agent specialization patterns are most effective for contract analysis tasks (drafting, review, compliance checking)?
    \item How does a multi-agent approach compare to single-agent systems in contract analysis accuracy and processing time?
    \item What explainability features are essential for enterprise users to trust multi-agent contract analysis results?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Research Objectives:} (1) Design a focused multi-agent framework for contract analysis based on industry foundation papers, (2) Develop a working prototype with 2-3 specialized agents, (3) Conduct comparative evaluation using real contract data, (4) Establish practical implementation guidelines for enterprise CLM integration.
