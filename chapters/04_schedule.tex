\chapter{Schedule and Work Plan}\label{chapter:schedule}

\textbf{6-Month Timeline:} (1) Months 1-2: Literature review and system architecture design. (2) Months 3-4: Detailed MAS design and prototype development. (3) Months 5-6: Implementation, data collection, and user studies. (4) Months 7-8: Analysis and evaluation. (5) Months 9-10: Writing and finalization.

\textbf{Risk Mitigation:} Incremental development approach for prototype complexity, standard interfaces for enterprise integration, early industry engagement for user study participation, and flexible analysis approaches if needed.

\textbf{Success Metrics:} Technical milestones (prototype functionality), research outcomes (statistical significance), user acceptance (positive feedback), academic contribution (novel insights), and timeline adherence.
